# Lessons Learned

- MVC architecture can help to organize the codebase: By separating the application logic into models, views, and controllers, it becomes easier to maintain and extend the codebase. It also promotes the separation of concerns and makes the code easier to test.

- React can be a powerful tool for building user interfaces: React's component-based approach allows for reusable and modular code, which can save time and effort in the long run. React's virtual DOM also helps to optimize the rendering performance of the application.
